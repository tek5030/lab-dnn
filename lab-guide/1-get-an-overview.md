# Step 1: Get an overview
Today we will play around with pre-trained models and apply them to our live camera stream using OpenCV.

You should begin by looking at the [examples][zoo/samples] presented in the README file for the "Model Zoo For OpenCV DNN".
As you can see, there are models for object detection, face recognition, segmentation and more.
Browse the [opencv_zoo/models] directory of the repository
and look at the provided examples.

You can also take a look at the [opencv/samples/dnn] directory and the [OpenCV tutorials for dnn module]
to see a handful of OpenCV applications that we can implement and run.
Check specifically the [opencv/samples/dnn/README.md](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/4.x/samples/dnn/README.md)
file, and browse the OpenCV wiki [Deep Learning in OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Deep-Learning-in-OpenCV).

As you can see, you don't need many lines of code to do advanced image processing when you can rely on pre-trained models
and OpenCV.

In the next step, we will simply run some of the demos from the model zoo to familiarize ourselves with the process.

Please continue to the [next step](2-model-zoo.md).
